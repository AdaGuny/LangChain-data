- Input/Output Analysis 
- What is shown in monetary input-output tables (MIOT)? Structure, contents, units 

Monetary input-output tables consist of a matrix showing the monetary flows between the different sectors of the economy. The columns represent the sectors or industries and the rows represent the origin and destination of the monetary transactions. The entries in the matrix show the monetary value of the transactions between the sectors. 

Typically, MIOTs contain the following information:
-Production figures
-final demand
-Intermediate expenditure
-Income
The units in a MIOT can vary by country and source. For example, production figures can be expressed in physical units such as tonnes or pieces, while monetary flows are expressed in currency units such as dollars or euros.

- How can MIOT also be used for sub-sectors of an economy?

By extracting the data in the context of the desired sub-sectors, analysts can examine the interrelationships, linkages and impacts within those specific sectors. e.g. regional analysis, sector analysis, environmental analysis, investment analysis

- Bonus: What do input coefficients express? What do you need the Leontief inverse for?

Input coefficients indicate how much input a sector needs to produce one unit of output. They show the dependence of a sector on inputs from other sectors. The Leontief inverse is used to calculate the impact of a change in demand on the entire economy and to analyse the indirect effects on production, income and employment.

- Measures of freight transport and their significance

Quantity mass:
Weight (e.g. [t])
Volume (e.g. [m3 ]) 
Value of goods (e.g. EUR) 
Small load carriers (e.g. box pallets, pallets)
Loading metre
Large load carriers (containers, swap bodies, 20-foot container equivalent) 
Freight orders (note: subcontracting, transport chains) 
Transport lot size/shipment size: quantity of goods collected together at a source and delivered together at a sink 
Journeys (with and without load)
Tours (closed chains of journeys)

Performance measure:
tkm(transport performance) -> In freight transport, transport performance is measured in tonne-kilometres (tkm): the kilometres travelled multiplied by the quantity of goods transported in tonnes.
Pallet-km (for individual company analyses)
Vehicle-km(mileage)

Approximately what does the modal split in Germany look like in terms of volume and performance?



However, road transport continues to dominate the modal split in Germany, followed by rail transport, while the shares of the other modes are comparatively lower.

- Which types of goods have an affinity for rail, which have an affinity for inland waterways, which goods are almost
transported almost exclusively by truck?

Goods with an affinity for rail:
-Bulk goods such as coal, ore, gravel and sand
-bulk goods such as grain, cement, fertilisers and chemicals
-containers for intermodal transport (combination of rail and road)

Goods with affinity to inland waterways vessels:
-Heavyweight goods such as steel, iron and scrap metal
-Liquid goods such as crude oil, natural gas and chemicals
-Containers for inland waterway transport

Goods that are almost exclusively transported by truck:
-Fresh goods such as fruit, vegetables and dairy products that need to reach consumers quickly and directly.
-express shipments and courier services that require fast delivery.

-Deliveries to remote or hard-to-reach areas where truck transport is the most practical option.




- Draw qualitatively a typical distance distribution curve (percent over distance) for road freight transport!

The distance distribution curve shows the percentage distribution of transports over different distance intervals. The horizontal axis shows the distance intervals, while the vertical axis shows the percentage of transports in each interval.

Distance category Percentage of road freight transports
0-50 km 40%
50-100 km 30%
100-200 km 15%
200-500 km 10%
500-1000 km 3%
over 1000 km 2%

- Approximately how large is the share of foreign trucks in cross-border freight traffic in Germany?

In 2021 and 2022, the share of foreign trucks on German federal trunk roads is approximately 42%.

- What is the approximate share of cargo journeys in total journeys by German HGVs?
What dependency can be observed (important factor influencing the share of empty journeys)?
How can it be explained?

Based on existing data and estimates, the share of cargo trips was generally around 60-70% of total trips by German trucks. This means that about 30-40% of the trips were made without cargo or with only partial cargo.

The share of empty trips depends on several important influencing variables:
-demand and supply
-Route planning and logistics optimisation
-Return and cooperation opportunities
-Geographical distribution of freight
The empty run share can also be influenced by other factors such as seasonal fluctuations, traffic-related delays, logistical restrictions or the availability of loads.


- For example, what is the degree of utilisation (of the maximum payload) of German trucks? What dependency can be observed (important influencing variable)? How can it be explained?

The average load factor of German trucks is about 50% to 60%.

Some important factors influencing the degree of utilisation of trucks:
-the demand for transport services 
-the supply of freight 
-the number of available trucks 

There are several factors that can influence this demand:
-economic conditions
-industry-specific demand
-Logistics and supply chain strategies
-Infrastructure and transport
-Environmental requirements and regulations

- What are important data sources for freight transport in Germany and Europe?

Statistical offices
Transport associations and organisations
Transport infrastructure operators
Company data
Research institutes and universities
Telematics and monitoring systems

-the right product
-at the right time 
-at the right place
-in the right quantity
-in the right quality 
-at the right cost

- Name functions of logistics.

Order and inventory management
Warehousing and picking 
Transport and handling
Operation of an information system

- Outline the following transport networks as examples: single wagon network, CT, general cargo and part loads.

Single wagon network: refers to a transport system in which individual freight wagons are transported independently between different locations or hubs. In contrast to a block train transport system, where several wagons are transported as a coherent unit, in the single wagon network the goods are transported individually.

CT: The aim of combined transport is to exploit the advantages of the individual modes of transport along the transport chain. For example, rail or ship can be used for transport over long distances, while road is used for the final distribution stage.

General cargo: refers to the transport of goods packed in individual pieces or packages, as opposed to bulk or full loads.


Partial load network: it is a network of freight forwarders, logistics companies and carriers that pool their capacities to transport partial loads.

        
        Ad-hoc structures vs. network

- Which tour types can be distinguished?

- What are the special requirements of logistics networks in the automotive and retail sectors?

in the automotive industry
▪ Just in time - production and delivery in quantity and time according to customer requirements 
                       - Shorter lead times and lower capital commitment 
                       - BUT: high need for coordination along the supply chain 
▪ Just in Sequence - extension of JIT 
                              - Delivery in the right order 
▪ Demand on logistics networks 
▪ Effect: settlement of supplier companies in the immediate vicinity of car manufacturers
 
in the trade
-High flexibility

▪ Requirement for logistics networks 
▪ Effect: settlement of supplier companies in the immediate vicinity of the car manufacturer
 
in the trade
-High flexibility and adaptability: to react quickly to changes and transport products efficiently from suppliers to points of sale.
-Omnichannel distribution
-Returns management: returns and returns play a major role in retail. 

--------
in the automotive industry:
Just-in-Time (JIT) and Just-in-Sequence (JIS): the automotive industry often requires precise delivery of components and parts to the assembly line. JIT and JIS principles mean that materials must be provided at exactly the right time and in the right sequence so as not to interrupt production processes.
High delivery reliability: Automotive manufacturing requires high reliability in the delivery of materials and components. Delays or failures can lead to significant production delays and costs.
Complex parts management: Automotive manufacturing involves a large number of parts and components sourced from different suppliers. Parts management requires effective tracking, monitoring and coordination of material flows to ensure that the right parts are in the right place at the right time.

In retail:
High inventory levels and turnover rates: Retail often requires a wide range of products and high availability to meet customer demand. This can lead to high inventory levels that need to be effectively managed and controlled to minimise losses and ensure fast turnaround.
Omnichannel distribution: Retailers are increasingly adopting omnichannel strategies where products are offered through different distribution channels such as brick-and-mortar shops, online shops and marketplaces. This requires a well-integrated logistics network to ensure seamless fulfilment of orders and effective inventory management across all channels.
Returns management: Returns management plays an important role in e-commerce and retail. It is important to have an efficient process for the return, inspection, reprocessing and reuse of returned products to minimise costs and improve customer service.
Customised packaging and labelling: In retail, there may be special requirements for product packaging and labelling, such as customised packaging, barcodes or security labels. Logistics networks must be able to meet these requirements and package and label products accordingly.
These specific requirements demand close cooperation between manufacturers, suppliers, logistics service providers and retailers in order to create efficient 
logistics networks

- Explain the terms contract logistics, just-in-time and just-in-sequence.

Contract logistics
- Long-term takeover of complex logistical service packages by logistics service providers (freight forwarders, parcel services) 
- Combination of several services (transport, storage, handling and packaging, also simple production or assembly activities)
- Service provider as system supplier for logistics services (Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon)

Just in time 
- Production and delivery in quantity and time according to customer requirements
- Shorter lead times and lower capital commitment 
- BUT: high need for coordination along the supply chain

Just in Sequence

Drivers and trends
- Main features and statements of the important trade models: Ricardo, Krugman/Core-Periphery,
Economies-of-Scale.

Ricardo: 
-Comparative Cost Advantage. 
-The basic assumption is the existence of different labour productivities and resulting different opportunity costs. 

Core-Periphery Model (Paul Krugman): 
-Capital and labour are mobile.
-Regional economic output increases disproportionately to inputs (economies of scale). 
  
Economies of scale:
-Certain regions become stronger and stronger.
-Other regions suffer a backwash effect and are reduced to commodity production.

- What do indifference and transformation curves express?

Indifference curves express a consumer's consumption preferences by representing all combinations of goods that are available to him or her.
 They show the trade-offs a consumer is willing to make in order to choose between different goods.

Transformation curves represent the production possibilities of an economy, i.e. the different production combinations of two goods that can be achieved with the given resources and technology.




- What are the benefits of improvements in freight transport for companies and countries?

Benefits for companies:
-Increased efficiency: shorter delivery times, faster response times to customer requests.
-Cost reduction: reduction of transport costs, optimised route planning, better -utilisation of transport means
-Expanded market access: reach new markets, new sales possibilities and opportunities
-Increased customer satisfaction: faster delivery times and reliable transport services, strengthening of customer loyalty

Benefits for countries:
-Economic growth: new jobs, increase in GDP.
-Strengthening competitiveness
-Better regional development
-Better developed infrastructure and logistics services

- What is meant by globalisation and what consequences has it had for intercontinental
and national freight transport?

Globalisation = international integration of economy and politics.
Consequences: Fragmentation of value chains 
s- Standardised production processes 
- Fragmentation of value chains 
- Cost reduction through outsourcing
Current: risks, loss of capital, dependence on foreign countries, depolarisation

- What other trends - besides globalisation - have had an impact on freight transport in recent decades?
had an impact on freight transport in recent decades?

- Technical progress: Through technical progress, either the same quantity of production (output) can be produced with a lower input of labour or means of production (inputs) or a higher quantity can be produced with the same input of means of production and labour.

- Structural change in the economy: The changes in the primary, secondary and tertiary sector share of gross value added.

- Explain the reasons for outsourcing in industry and the consequences for freight transport.

Cheaper labour costs (e.g. Hungary, Poland, China, labour contract logistics...) 
Concentration on core competences 
Accumulation of competences 
Realisation of economies of scale and scope with suppliers (e.g. Bosch) 
Replacement of capital costs by variable factor costs
Gain in flexibility
Increase in (own) capital return
Flexible replenishment (in terms of space, time, quantity) instead of warehousing  
Interfaces and digitalisation 

Ek bilgi: "Offshoring" refers to the relocation of a company's tasks abroad. It is therefore a geographical relocation, while outsourcing concerns organisational relocation.


- What effects do transport improvements (e.g. construction of infrastructure) have on logistics and production structures and then on freight transport?

Improvement of delivery times
Reduction of transport costs
Improving reliability
Expansion of market access
Locational advantages: Transport improvements can increase the attractiveness of certain locations. 
Promoting trade: transporting products over long distances and accessing international supply chains.
